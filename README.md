## Hello Python 

### Description 
  In this assignment we make a python code that if you click enter gives you a random number 1 to 6 and if you click x and enter it quits the application

### Lessons Learned 
  In this assignment I reacquainted myself with python commands and terminal commands. Like how you end functions with colon's and that strings are str. I also learned that else ifs are elif. I learned that nano is how to edit a file and if you only have reading access you can use sudo nano. I learned that "python3 file name" runs the code in that file. Also during my creation of the the file I miss named it so I also learned that using "rm file name" you can remove files.

## Calculator

### Description
  In this assignment we make a python code that asks for two integers to be inputted by the user.
    
### Lessons Learned 
  In this assignment I learned how to def functions by using "def function name():" and any parameters you need you can put in the parantheses. I also learned that the round function is simply just "round(math function, number of digits to round)". Also I learned that I had to return my integer answer as a string to print it.

## Quadratic Solver

### Description
  In this assignment we make a code that finds out if there are roots of a quadratic with 3 user inputted coefficients and if there are roots it finds them and puts them into an array and prints them. 
    
### Lessons Learned 
  In this assignment I learned how to make a array/list by setting a variable = []. I learned the command variable.append(number) this adds a number or string to the list at the end. I learned that the ** is the math operator for an exponent. I also learned the raspberry pi command sudo shutdown -h now which will shut down the raspberry pi.
